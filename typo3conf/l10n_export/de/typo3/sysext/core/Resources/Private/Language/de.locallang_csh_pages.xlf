'Backend User Section' is an option which creates pages that are only visible in the Frontend for Backend users who are logged in.

'Shortcut' pages jump to another page in the Pagetree.
'Mount Point' pages bring content from another branch of the Pagetree into the current branch.
'Link to External URL' is similar to 'Shortcut' but points to external URLs instead of TYPO3 pages.

&lt;b&gt;Special&lt;/b&gt;
'Folder' is a page type which is not shown as a webpage but is instead stores records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in the Recycler are not visible in the Frontend.
'Menu Separator' is only useful if your Frontend memus are programmed to use it. It does not represent a page with content but is intended to be an unclickable placeholder in the menu.

&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt; Each Page Type is represented by a unique icon. The available page types can be restricted for users so all of the options described above may not be visible.

To optimize your page for search engines like Google you should not use more than 3 to 6 keywords. You should also make sure that the keywords are found in the content of the page.

Note that search engine extensions for TYPO3 such as Indexed Search can also be configured to make use of the keywords.

The keywords can also be used to create a menu of related pages. Create a Content Element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/i&gt;.</target></trans-unit>

In addition, the description will be displayed if you create a Content Element of type 'Sitemap' and then choose the menu type &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt;. If an abstract exists for the page, it will be used instead of the description.
