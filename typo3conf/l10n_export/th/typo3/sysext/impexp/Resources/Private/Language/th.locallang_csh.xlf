				<source>In the "Select preset" box you can select any previously saved preset to load. If you are exporting a page the presets listed will be those found for the start page ID. For records, any preset can be loaded.
To load a preset, select it in the selector and press "Load". If you press "Merge" instead the settings from the preset will be merged with the current configuration. This is meaningful in cases where you select multiple individual tables or records.
To save a preset, simply enter a title in the title box and press "Save". This will create a new preset. If you press save while having selected an existing preset you will overwrite it.
To delete old presets, simply select it and press "Delete".

The checkbox "Public" can be set if you want to share your preset with other users of the system. Otherwise they are personal to you.
