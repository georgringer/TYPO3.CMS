				<source>The frequency of the task can be simply entered as a number of seconds.

Alternatively it is possible to use the same syntax as for cron jobs. This is simply a list of five numbers or the wildcard "*", separated by blanks. The five numbers are (in order) minutes, hours, day of month, months and day of week. Examples:

*/5 * * * * means every 5 minutes
30 22 * * * means every day at 22:30

The Scheduler supports the full cron syntax.</source>
